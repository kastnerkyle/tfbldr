sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
we surely shall see the sun shine soon.
lesser leather never weathered wetter weather better.
near an ear, a nearer ear, a nearly eerie ear.
the sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.
all this happened, more or less.
